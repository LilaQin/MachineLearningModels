# MachineLearningModels
Hi guys,
I uploaded my  solutions to assignments of UCI CS284: Representations & Algorithms for Molecular Biology.
In this course, Professor Xie introduced basic machine learning algorithms models which are used in modern biology. And we are asked to implement those models in matlab. 
There are 4 assignments. The file named in Assignemnt X is the main program for this assignment, you can learn about requirements of assignments and what model is implemented in this assignment. 
1st assignment: implement linear regression in Gradient Desscent and Normal Equation way.
2nd assignment: implement logistic regression; understand and implement logistic regression with Ridge Regression; use Cross-validation procedure to choose regularization parameter;
3rd assignment: implements a simple neural network model(the total of layers is 3) for binary classification, involving forwardpropagation and backpropagation. 
4rd assignment: implement A K-means clustering algorithm; implement a Gaussian Mixture Model
